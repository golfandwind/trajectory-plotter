Step 1: Load all the files to your MATLAB directory
Step 2: Choose the ball out of hexagonal dimpled (default) and conventional dimpled
Step 3: Replace the variables "CDmodel" and "CLmodel" in the file "ballParameters.mat" with the same variables from the file "bearmanHexData.mat" or "bearmanConvData.mat" as per your choice of ball
Step 4: Call the function plotTrajectory() with the launch conditions as function arguments
